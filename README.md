# The aquisition-memorization tradeoff of the human visual working memory

This is work from a lab rotation with the [cognitive neuroscience department](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/biologie/institute/neurobiologie/lehrbereiche/cognitive-neuroscience/) where we replicated findings from [Hardiess & Mallot, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2015.05.017) and showed, that there is a tradeoff between aquisition and memorization in a visual search paradigm.

The work for this lab rotation was summarized in a protocol that you can view [here](protocol/main.pdf).
